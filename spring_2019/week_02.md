## Last Week's Accomplishments

In the previous week I continued to work on the hub by implementing a temporary format for cells in the hub. 

1) Profile:  I added an imageview which will link to the profile image to be displayed whenever the user posts. In addition, a text label can be seen next to this for the username. Ultimately this text label and profile image will segue to the original poster's profile.

2) Message: In the cell I also added a label to store the message the user posts asking for riders to join them. To add to this I will need to put 2 more labels with the time and the date. A temporary message was added for displaying purpose.

3) Bottom refresh: A refresh or 'load more' spinning wheel has been added to the bottom of the hub tableview which only appears when approaching the bottom of the currently loaded cells. This is similar to apps like facebook and instagram. Currently not functional.

## This Week's Plan

In the coming week I want to be able to create an account and pull from the database. ie. I want to try actual posts on the page. I also want to make it so scrolling onto the bottom of the view actually loads more cells. Lastly, I want to continue to finish one of last weeks goals which is to add segues and functionality to the buttons in the settings menu.

## Anything Blocking?

The database must be setup before I can test the hub with actual data. Time management is also an issue as I have just become a pledge. My time is not necessarily my own.
