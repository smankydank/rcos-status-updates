## Last Week's Accomplishments

In the previous week I mostly did research on how to properly load new cells in the bottom of a tableview. In addition I was looking for ways to make a post in the "make a post" tab. This would include connecting to the database (firebase), sending post data and such. In addition, users would need to be separated by followers / people in the vicinity on the hub.

## This Week's Plan

This week I hope to be more up to speed and want to at least have a non-firebase based posting functionality so that from there I can talk to the database people and get everything to work. I also finally want to be able to load more posts on the bottom of the main table view.

## Anything Blocking?

This week I had to buckle down and focus on my exam in CANOS & the beginning of pledging so I did not have much time to allot towards RCOS and the team project. I had a pledge event every night and the nights I did not needed to be used to study for the exam or else I would fail. However, I am no longer pledging due to stress and other complications so I should be able to keep more up to pace with work in the coming weeks.
