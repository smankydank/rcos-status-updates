## Last Week's Accomplishments
The first thing I did this week was attempt to implement the date picker. The issue however was the aesthetic. The IOS built in datepicker scrolled around and did not allow for a minimum or maximum date to be set. In addition it was too big and not customisable enough for our purposes. So after a few hours of playing around with it, I decided to scratch it and go with 2 uitextfields (1 for date and 1 for time) in addition to a segmented controller for selecting AM vs PM. I have been researching how to use both so next week I can implement.

## This Week's Plan
If anything I want to use my research on UITextfiled and the segmented controller to actually implement them to perform desired functions. If possible I would want to check the text entered to ensure a valid date or time. 

## Anything Blocking?
I have my 2nd exam for algo this week and I really need to do well so it is likely not much will be getting done.
## Notes
nothing to report
