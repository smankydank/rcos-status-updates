## Last Week's Accomplishments
(1) Fix constraints on profile page
- add 1 : 1 aspect ratio to image to allow for appopriate scaling on all phone types
- Add proper spacing to all objects on the page
- Add new table_view to replace button that was previously there for selecting old posts and replying to them

(2) Added ProfileViewController and did basic setup in the page to allow for future integration with the database. This includes adding in the requried tableview functions for proper functionality (however, they will need to be filled in later)

(3) Added the PostReplyViewController and connected it to the Profile page and the Hub page. Ultimately posts will be able to get clicked on in the tableviews in both pages and then will be taken from the database to be loaded on this page. 

## This Week's Plan
This weeks plan is to continue to work on the app and add any additional featuers I can before the end of the semester. More than likely this will include finishing up the skeleton to the app, fixing bugs, and adding comments so the next group that works on this will have an easier time understanding and implementing the remaining features in the app.

## Anything Blocking?
Only issue is IED presentation Friday and the fact the database is not completely setup yet. 

## Notes
nothing to report
