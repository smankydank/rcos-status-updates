## Last Week's Accomplishments
(1) The primary objective for this week was to prepare for the presentation for our group on April 12th. My job in the presentation was to demonstrate the functionality of the IOS version of our project (ie. to show where we started and where we currently are in addition to show off all features) Some of the features I showed off included:
    - Email verification/Login system
    - Converging (side) menu / logout feature
    - Main hub cell scrolling and loading at bottom
    - Main hub refresh / scroll to top by pressing logo
    - post page notification if info was entered incorrectly
    - twitter based message feature with limited characters and lines
    - profile page
Lastly, for this presentation I had to contribute to the slides by setting up the demo slides with bullets and images for IOS. 

## This Week's Plan
This weeks plan is to continue to work on the app and add any additional featuers I can before the end of the semester. I want to work on the profile page ideally to allow for a skeleton rating system and comments, and I want to finish off the posting page by adding in an original location & destination UITextfield. 

## Anything Blocking?
This week is extremily busy for me. I have an IED project due at the end of the week and and exam on Wednesday, but I will do my best to accomplish my goals anyways.
